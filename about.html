                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Our story began in 1971. Back then we were a roaster and retailer of whole bean and ground
                        coffee, tea and spices with a single store in Seattle’s Pike Place Market. Today, we are
                        privileged to connect with millions of customers every day in more than 80 markets.</p>
                    <h3>Folklore</h3>
                    <p>Starbucks is named after the first mate in Herman Melville’s “Moby-Dick.” Our logo is also
                        inspired by the sea – featuring a twin-tailed siren from Greek mythology.</p>
                    <h3>Starbucks Mission, Values and Promises</h3>
                    <h4>Our Mission</h4>

                        eliminate waste. We know we can’t do it alone. It takes all of us.</p>
